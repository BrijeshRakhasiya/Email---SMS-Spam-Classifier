# Email & SMS Spam Classifier

## Overview

The **Email & SMS Spam Classifier** is a machine learning-based project designed to classify whether a given email or SMS message is **spam** or **ham (non-spam)**. The classifier leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze textual data and categorize messages accurately.

In todayâ€™s world, spam messages can clog our email inboxes and SMS systems, making it essential to develop reliable filters to automatically detect and block such messages. This project builds a classifier to automate this process, helping to prevent unwanted messages from reaching the user.

## Key Features

- **Spam vs. Ham Classification**: Classifies messages into spam and non-spam categories.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project performs various preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for training.
- **Multiple Models**: The project uses multiple machine learning models to train the classifier, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and more.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluation of the model's performance based on key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of labeled emails and SMS messages. Each message is classified into one of two categories:
- **Spam**: Unwanted, unsolicited, or junk messages.
- **Ham**: Non-spam, legitimate messages.

### Dataset Features:
- **Text**: The content of the email/SMS message.
- **Label**: The classification of the message (either **spam** or **ham**).
